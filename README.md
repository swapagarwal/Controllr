Take control of usage time

## How to use?

  1. Run main.py
  2. Select the program that you want to monitor and set the max time limit.
  3. Double click to open the generated file. It'll run in background and monitor the selected program.
  4. Once the limit is crossed, it'll forcefully close that program. It'll also keep on monitoring further instances and close those too.

### About:

This was primarily made to control my continuous watching of movies and soaps in summer vacation.
Use this on other programs (browsers, etc.) at your own risk!
